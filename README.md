# Active Semi-Supervised Learning Image Validator

This is just an utility script for the validation of images in active semi-supervised learning projects.

The script is written in HTML + JavaScript and therefore it should not require any external installation and/or configuration.
You can just download the entire directory and use it in any computer.

The software was tested under ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white).
The software was tested on ![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-FF7139?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firefox-Browser&logoColor=white) and ![Edge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Edge-0078D7?style=for-the-badge&logo=Microsoft-edge&logoColor=white) browsers.

You can easily manage the language of buttons and texts setting the `LANGUAGE` variable in [`function`](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/active_learning_validator/blob/main/static/function.js) script: the available languages are only *ita* and *eng* up to now.
